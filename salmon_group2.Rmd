The Niagara of the West - Willamette Falls is the largest falls in Oregon. The river was once filled with salmon and Pacific lamprey and for thousands of years this area was a significant fishing place for the Clackamas People. Close contact with early European fur traders had devastating effects on the Clackamas People and by 1851 nearly 97% of the Native people in this area had died from foreign diseases ([Lewis, 2014](https://ndnhistoryresearch.com/2014/12/15/clackamas-people-of-willamette-falls/#:~:text=The%20Clackamas%20People%20helped%20early,south%20into%20the%20Willamette%20Valley.&text=Willamette%20Falls%20was%20the%20main,or%20leap%20over%20the%20falls.)). 

Industrialization of the area in the late 1800's also lead to reduced fish runs, thus a fish ladder was built in 1982 and later rebuilt in 1971 to help. The Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife currently manages it and has recorded the monthly fish passage through Willamette Falls fishway.  Counts are conducted 24 hrs/day, 365 days/year using using video cameras and time lapsed video recorders at the main viewing window. The following report explores the adult passage of coho, jack-coho, and steelhead salmon through the Willamette Falls fish ladder using the data collected by Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife.

## Tab 1: Original time series 

As shown in the figure below: 

 *  Steelhead salmon had a large presence in 2001 (approx. 400 fish per day), while Coho and Jack Coho salmon did not appear in the passage during 2001 (zero fish per day).
 *  The recorded number of Coho fish increased as time increased, with the most recorded Coho salmon in 2010.
 *  There is a constant trended in the recorded number of Jack Coho, except for a peak in late 2008. 
 *  All three fish seem to have a seasonal trend, where some months have more recorded salmon than others. For example, more Steelhead salmon are found during the Spring months.

```

## Tab 2: Seasonplots

Major trends:

  *   Jack Coho and Coho species are present between September through December, but not the rest of the year.
  *   Steelhead are present almost year round, with most counts recorded in late spring. 
  *   Jack Coho and Coho population counts peak in 2009 and 2010 respectively, while Steelhead population count peaks in 2002.

## Tab 3: Annual counts by species

The annual total counts of fish passage for steelhead, coho, and jack-coho at Willamette Falls fish ladder is shown in Figure 3. The total annual counts shown below are from 2001-2010. Some of of the major trends include:

  *  Steelhead are the most abundant of the three species to pass through the Willamette Falls fish ladder with counts ranging roughly between 20,000 - 40,000.
  * Jack-coho are the least abundant of the three species with the annual totals for fish passage remaining below 3,000 from 2001-2010.
  *  There was a large increase in annual abundance of Coho in 2009 & 2010 where counts went from ~4,000 to over 25,000.
