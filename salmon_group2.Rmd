The Niagara of the West - Willamette Falls is the largest falls in Oregon. The river was once filled with salmon and Pacific lamprey and for thousands of years this area was a significant fishing place for the Clackamas People. Close contact with early European fur traders had devastating effects on the Clackamas People and by 1851 nearly 97% of the Native people in this area had died from foreign diseases ([Lewis, 2014](https://ndnhistoryresearch.com/2014/12/15/clackamas-people-of-willamette-falls/#:~:text=The%20Clackamas%20People%20helped%20early,south%20into%20the%20Willamette%20Valley.&text=Willamette%20Falls%20was%20the%20main,or%20leap%20over%20the%20falls.)). 

Since 1961, Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife has recorded the monthly fish passage through Willamette Falls fishway.  Counts are conducted 24 hrs/day, 365 days/year using using video cameras and time lapsed video recorders at the main viewing window.
  
  Here is a map of the fish ladder location!

## Tab 1: Original time series 

As shown in the figure below: 

 *  Steelhead salmon had a large presence in 2001 (approx. 400 fish per day), while Coho and Jack Coho salmon did not appear in the passage during 2001 (zero fish per day).
 *  The recorded number of Coho fish increased as time increased, with the most recorded Coho salmon in 2010.
 *  There is a constant trended in the recorded number of Jack Coho, except for a peak in late 2008. 
 *  All three fish seem to have a seasonal trend, where some months have more recorded salmon than others. For example, more Steelhead salmon are found during the Spring months.
